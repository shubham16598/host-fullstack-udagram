CI/CD Process:

1) Github is used as a collaboration platform and to keep the code repository.

2) Circle CI is used for the Integration and Deployment Purposes.

Whenever a Code is push to github, CircleCI gets triggered and the Frontend build is made and deployed to the server.

Steps:

Code Push ---> Github ---> CircleCI Trigger ---> Linting check code ---> Unit Tests ---> Deployment
